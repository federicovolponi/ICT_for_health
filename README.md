# ICT for Health

During the *ICT for Health* course of the *ICT for Smart Societies* master's degree at Politecnico di Torino I had the opportunity to work with some machine learning algorithms both supervised and unsupervised.
- LAB0: implementation of some minimization algorithms such as gradient algorithm, steepest gradient descent, and LLS.
- LAB01: linear regression on Parkinson's disease data
- LAB02: Gaussian process regression on Parkinson's disease data
- LAB03: ROC curve and AUC on Covid19 data related to serological and swab tests
- LAB04: Activities classification given sensor data using K-Means (not the best choice but was mandatory to use it)
- LAB05: Decision trees and random forest on Kidney disease data
